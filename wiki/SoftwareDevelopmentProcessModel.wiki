=Software development process model:=

We will follow *_Evolutionary development model because_*->

•	Requirements are not very clear

•	We need to take user input and constantly and improve our product. 

•	We are focusing on IIITD members right now; we will also like to see if any improvement or changes will be required for others.

•	Our project will evolve dynamically and different versions can be launched before final model.
