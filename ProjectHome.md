An applet that will keep track of the payments in a group and notify everyone about the payment details.

This project is being developed as a _course project_ for **Software Engineering(CSE 300)** course at _IIIT-Delhi_, India for the monsoon semester 2011.


# Description #

Usually we have coffee or food in a group, and only one or two people pay. Others pay them back later. This happens all the time and is "kinda complicated". We intend to develop an applet for IIIT-D which will enable instant, cashless, simple, secure, and convenient transfer of small money to the person.
Also the one whose is supposed to get the payment does not have to keep track of it, the applet will take care of every transaction and dues. All the communication will be done through SMS as it is the simplest form of communication.

A trusted and secure "BANK" will be provided by the institute where those who want the service can deposit amount in their account(phone number). After every instant transaction the user will get a confirmation and they can get the cash from the "BANK" whenever they want.

The application will consist of two modules, one is mobile application where the person will enter the amount and people present who have to share this amount and other is the server where all the details will be captured for the transactions and will send notifications to those people.
