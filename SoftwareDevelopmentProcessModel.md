# Software development process model: #

We will follow **_Evolutionary development model because_**->

•	Requirements are not very clear

•	We need to take user input and constantly and improve our product.

•	We are focusing on IIITD members right now; we will also like to see if any improvement or changes will be required for others.

•	Our project will evolve dynamically and different versions can be launched before final model.
